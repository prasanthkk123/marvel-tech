# 🚀 How to Run MarvelTech on GitHub - Quick Guide

## 📋 Current Status
✅ **Java 21 Upgrade**: Complete  
✅ **GitHub Actions**: Configured with Java 21  
✅ **Frontend Deployment**: Ready for GitHub Pages  
✅ **Backend Configuration**: Spring Boot with H2 database  

## 🚀 Steps to Run on GitHub

### 1. **Push Your Code to GitHub**
```powershell
# Using the provided script
.\github-push.ps1

# Or manually
git add .
git commit -m "Java 21 upgrade with CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

### 2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (One-time setup)
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/prasanthkk123/marvel-tech`
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
4. Save the settings

### 3. **Monitor the Build**
- Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
- Watch the **🚀 MarvelTech CI/CD Pipeline** run
- Build process includes:
  - ✅ Backend tests with Java 21
  - ✅ Frontend tests with React
  - ✅ Automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

### 4. **Access Your Live Application**
- **Frontend**: `https://prasanthkk123.github.io/marvel-tech/`
- **Backend**: Runs during CI/CD (for testing), needs separate hosting for production

## 🤖 What Happens Automatically

### On Every Push to `main`:
1. **🔧 Backend Pipeline**:
   - Sets up Java 21 environment
   - Runs Maven tests
   - Builds Spring Boot JAR

2. **⚛️ Frontend Pipeline**:
   - Sets up Node.js 18
   - Runs React tests with coverage
   - Creates production build

3. **🌐 Deployment**:
   - Deploys frontend to GitHub Pages
   - Available at your GitHub Pages URL

## 📁 What's Been Updated for GitHub

### Files Modified for Java 21:
- ✅ `backend/pom.xml` - Updated to Java 21
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` - Updated to use Java 21
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated prerequisites
- ✅ `RUNNING-ON-GITHUB.md` - Updated with CI/CD info

### New Files Created:
- ✅ `github-push.ps1` - PowerShell script to push to GitHub
- ✅ `github-push.sh` - Bash script to push to GitHub
- ✅ `setup-java21.ps1` - Local Java 21 setup
- ✅ `JAVA21-UPGRADE-SUMMARY.md` - Upgrade documentation

## 🎯 Quick Start Commands

```powershell
# 1. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)
.\github-push.ps1

# 2. Check build status
# Visit: https://github.com/prasanthkk123/marvel-tech/actions

# 3. View live site (after build completes)
# Visit: https://prasanthkk123.github.io/marvel-tech/
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting GitHub Issues

### Build Fails
- Check the **Actions** tab for detailed error logs
- Ensure all tests pass locally first
- Verify Java 21 compatibility

### GitHub Pages Not Working
- Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" source
- Check that the workflow has proper permissions
- Wait 5-10 minutes after first deployment

### Authentication Issues
- Use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`
- Or set up Personal Access Token for HTTPS
